# ESP Based IoT reporter
Project and Source files for custom PCB that implements various sensors with an ESP for reporting

This isn't really supposed to be anything super good or super cool, it's just me getting used to how to design boards.
I wanted to make a board that uses an ESP8266 to measure various things and report them to a cloud service.
This first version includes just measuring temperature and humidity throughout the house, with the option to expand and measure other things through I2C or Analog.

It includes an FTDI chip to program the ESP, the ESP itself, a temp/humidity sensor, and a Lithium-Ion charger with a connector for a Li-ion battery if I want to place it somewhere out of reach.
The repo will also include source code once I get my first batch of boards in.

Have fun with it if you think it's cool.
